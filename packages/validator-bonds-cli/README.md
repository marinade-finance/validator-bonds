# Validator Bonds CLI

CLI for Validator Bonds contract.

## Working with CLI

**Requirements:** Node.js version 16 or higher.

See

```bash
npm i -g @marinade.finance/validator-bonds-cli
validator-bonds --help
```

Successful installation will be shown in similar fashion to this output

# to verify installation run
validator-bonds --version
1.1.7
```


  **WARNING:** By default, the CLI employs confirmation finality to ensure transactions are `finalized`.
    For more details on the meaning of Solana finality, refer to the [documentation](https://solanacookbook.com/guides/retrying-transactions.html#after-a-transaction-is-processed-and-before-it-is-finalized).
    Please note that finalizing transactions may take several seconds, depending on the load of the Solana cluster. Use `--confirmation-finality confirmed` to speed-up processing
    with lower confirmation certainty.

### Creating a bond

Any validator may create a bond account to protect the processing.
The bond account is bound to a validator vote account.

```sh
# bond account at mainnet
validator-bonds -um init-bond -k <fee-payer-keypair> \
  --vote-account <vote-account-pubkey> --validator-identity <validator-identity-keypair> \
  --bond-authority <authority-on-bond-account-pubkey> \
  --rent-payer <rent-payer-account-keypair>

# to configure bond account properties
validator-bonds -um configure-bond --help
```

#### Bond creation details

The `init-bond` command initiates the creation of an account on the blockchain containing configuration data specific to a particular bond. This bond account is intricately linked with a corresponding vote account. The creation of a bond account requires a validator's identity signature, specifically one associated with the vote account.

The parameters and their meanings are explained in detail below:

* `--k <fee-payer-keypair>:` This parameter designates the account used to cover transaction costs (e.g., `5000` lamports).
* `--vote-account`: Specifies the vote account on which the bond will be established.
* `--validator-identity`: Represents the required signature; the validator identity must match one within the designated vote account.
* `--bond-authority`: Refers to any public key with ownership rights. It is recommended to use a ledger or multisig. This key does not necessarily need to correspond to an existing on-chain account (SOL preloading is unnecessary).
* `--rent-payer`: This account covers the creation cost of the Solana bond account, and it is expected to be the same as the fee payer (default).
   The rent cost is `0.00270048` SOL. Note that the `--rent-payer` is unrelated to bond security or "funding," which is addressed through a separate instruction. The bond's security is established by providing a stake account. The lamports in the stake account then corresponds to the SOL amount added to the security of the bond account. There is no direct payment of SOLs to the bond; it is accomplished solely by allocating stake accounts.

### Show the bond account

```sh
validator-bonds -um show-bond <bond-account-address> -f yaml

# to check with vote account address
validator-bonds -um show-bond --config vbMaRfmTCg92HWGzmd53APkMNpPnGVGZTUHwUJQkXAU --validator-vote-account <vote-account-address>
```

Expected output on created bond is like

```
validator-bonds -um show-bond ...
{
  programId: 'vBoNdEvzMrSai7is21XgVYik65mqtaKXuSdMBJ1xkW4',
  publicKey: '...',
  account: {
    config: 'vbMaRfmTCg92HWGzmd53APkMNpPnGVGZTUHwUJQkXAU',
    validatorVoteAccount: '...',
    authority: '...',
    revenueShare: { hundredthBps: 0 },
    bump: 255,
    reserved: { reserved: [Array] }
  }
}
```


## Support for Ledger signing

Any signature can be generated using Ledger by specifying either the pubkey 
(`usb://ledger/9rPVSygg3brqghvdZ6wsL2i5YNQTGhXGdJzF65YxaCQd`) or the path (`usb://ledger?key=0/0`)
as the parameter value.
For instance, if the bond authority is set up to be controlled by a key managed on Ledger, the command can be executed as follows:

```sh
# using solana-keygen to find pubkey on a particular derivation path
solana-keygen pubkey 'usb://ledger?key=0/3'

# using the ledger to sign as the authority to change the bond account configuration
validator-bonds -um configure-bond \
  --authority 'usb://ledger?key=0/3' --bond-authority <new-authority-pubkey> \
  <bond-account-address>
```

The support for ledger came from (`@marinade.finance/ledger-utils` TS implementation wrapper)[https://github.com/marinade-finance/marinade-ts-cli/tree/main/packages/lib/ledger-utils] around `@ledgerhq/hw-app-solana`. The implementation tries to be compatible with way how (`solana` CLI)[https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/v1.14.19/clap-utils/src/keypair.rs#L613] behaves.

## FAQ and issues

* **npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {**

  When running the `validator-bonds` cli the error continues as
  ```
  validator-bonds --help
  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@marinade.finance/validator-bonds-cli/node_modules/@solana/web3.js/lib/index.cjs.js:645
          keyMeta.isSigner ||= accountMeta.isSigner;
                            ^

  SyntaxError: Unexpected token '='
  ...
  ```

  **Solution:** old version of Node.js is installed on the machine. Node.js upgrade to version 16 or later is needed.

* **ExecutionError: Transaction XYZ not found**

  The CLI sent the transaction to blockchain but because of a connection
  or RPC issue the client was not capable to verify that the transaction
  has been processed successfully on chain

  ```
  err: {
        "type": "ExecutionError",
        "message": "... : Transaction ... not found, failed to get from ...",
        "stack":
            Error: ...
                at executeTx (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/@marinade.finance/validator-bonds-cli/node_modules/@marinade.finance/web3js-common/src/tx.js:86:15)
  ```

  **Solution:** Verify if the transaction `XYX` is at blockchain with a transaction explorer,
  e.g., https://explorer.solana.com/.
  Verify with the CLI. For example when bond should be initialized (`init-bond`)
  you can run search with CLI `validator-bonds -um show-bond --validator-vote-account <vote-account>`
  to check if account was created.

* **bigint: Failed to load bindings, ...**

  CLI shows error `the bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)`
  is caused by system configuration requirements from `@solana/web3.js` (details at https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/4077/bigint-failed-to-load-bindings-pure-js-will-be-used-try-npm-run-rebuild-whe). No functionality issues with this error.

  **Solution:** All works fine, nothing needed.
